# Introduction

We are familiar with the difficulties that accompany dealing with a school particularly while
record-keeping is involved.For a school to be appropriately managed ,the frameworks set up to
deal with all records of the school should be very much organized and moving along as
planned.

# Problem Statement

The methods involved in record keeping differ from set up to set up, but the more the system is
well structured the better it is for the management of records. Some schools still hold onto the old
ways of record-keeping through files and books which is very inefficient. For one the files can get
destroyed and retrieving the data is also very time consuming.
It is even worse for larger learning institutions that do not have good school management
frameworks in place. This can cause chaos and slow down production and work in the learning
environment.
Digilearn_Records is a platform designed to aid learning institutions manage their school
records better. They can be able to have all student details and also staff details all in one
place, which can be easily accessed. It is exceptionally productive and saves alot of time.
